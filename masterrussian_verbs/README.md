A good way to study verb conjugations in your target language with Anki is to make a bunch of cards for a single verb. Every card should ask you to conjugate the verb in a different way. For example: He (to know) the way -> He **knows** the way. I used to make these cards by hand. I found this process to be very tedious and time-consuming, since all you are doing is changing the pronoun and verb in a sentence. 

Masterrussian.com has an index with the top 500 most frequently used verbs. Every verb has a dedicated page containing the conjugations tables. This tool uses those verbs to generate conjugation cards in bulk. It does this by picking a verb from the list, scraping the conjugation tables from the page and converting them into cards. An image and general sentence need to be supplied. The output is a .txt file that can be imported into Anki.

Example output cards: 
- I (to know) the way -> I **know** the way.
- She (to know - past) the way -> She **knew** the way.
- We (to know - future) the way -> We **will know** the way.
